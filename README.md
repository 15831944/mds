### Ryan Burnside (Pixel_Outlaw)

Note: This is /not/ a good example of how to write clean code.
This is a rushed mess of spread logic and spaghetti code, don't use as a base for your project...please.

This is my entry for the Lisp Game Jam (Spring 2018)
Special thanks to "Borodust" for trivial-gamekit

Requires Quicklisp
(ql:quickload :mds)
(mds:run)

*Note* The game is locked to the monitor refresh rate.
Please purchase a 60hz monitor to play the game as intended. :P

How To Play:
Arrow keys OR WASD keys move the player. (dot with circle)
Each time you touch a bullet you'll shoot the enemies increasing your score.
However, if a bullet hits the dot in the middle you will lose a life.

There are 3 sloppily made levels. (Feel free to toy with levels.lisp to make more)
